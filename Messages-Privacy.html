    <h2>Collected Data</h2>
    <p>Messages are stored in firebase until delivery in which they are removed from the system entirely.</p>
    <p>User identifying tokens are stored on the server, along with data allowing for the server to connect to APNS on the user's behalf</p>
    <h2>Users interact</h2>
    <p>All messages come from other users, by using the app you recognize that messages are not filtered or monitored by the app</p>
